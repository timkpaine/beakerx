# Just the grid component from BeakerX

## Attribution

BeakerX contains and depends on many projects including:

The kernel is originally derived from
[lappsgrid](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-groovy-kernel),
but has been rewritten in Java and refactored and expanded.

The Java support uses Adrian Witas' org.abstractmeta.toolbox.
